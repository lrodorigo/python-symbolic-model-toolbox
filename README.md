# Python Symbolic Model Toolbox

A set of python utilities to work on non-linear systems control problems using finite-state, approximated label transition systems (LTS).
* Approximate complex non-linear ODE systems into countable graph
* Natively take into account real-words phenomena, such as sampling and quantization
* Design optimal controller respect to these non-idealities.
